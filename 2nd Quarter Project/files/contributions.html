                <p id="body">Ever since its foundation in 1961, the World Food Programme has constantly been involved in addressing global social issues primarily of hunger, conflict, natural disasters, and other global emergencies. From its first emergency operation in Iran during the September 1962 earthquake, and up to the present, the WFP has always been committed in fulfilling their mission of saving lives and changing lives. In which they have done over hundreds of millions of individuals across over a hundred countries worldwide.</p>
                <p id="body">However, in order to execute and fund all its missions and programs globally, the WFP relies 100% on the kind donations that it receives from contributors spread all over the world. These include government assistance, corporate donors, and kind-hearted individuals. Accordingly, the WFP makes it their responsibility to guarantee donors that their donations will go to good cause, and simultaneously ensure that these donations and funds, including yours in the case that you have donated, are used wisely, efficiently and transparently. </p>
                <p id="body">By contributing, you are helping in the global fight against hunger, as we ensure that your support will come a long way in feeding the hungry. By donating, you are also helping in the WFP's operations in global emergencies caused by disasters and conflict. Your donations will also help provide financial support to those in desperate need, as well as help build sustainable and resilient communities, and in the WFP's campaigns that advocate for gender equality and action against climate change.</p>
                <p id="body">The WFP has been and is always prepared to respond to the call of service, and contributing your part will greatly help in the funding and execution of their missions around the world.</p>
