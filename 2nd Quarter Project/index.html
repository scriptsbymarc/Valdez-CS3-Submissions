                <p id="body">The World Food Programme is the leading humanitarian organization globally. Operating in 123 countries and territories, their advocacy has always been to save lives and change lives through providing assistance in places riddled by emergencies, and through collaborating with local communities to address nutrition and create resilient environments within their localities. </p>
                <p id="body">With over 21,000 staff worldwide, the WFP has continuously worked to combat hunger by distributing emergency food assistance, launching information campaigns against malnutrition, and preventing famine by strengthening education, nutrition, livelihood resilience and social protection systems. The WFP has responded in countless life-saving situations through providing emergency relief, humanitarian support, material and financial support, and strategizing disaster risk reduction. In addition, the organization has endlessly worked with governments to promote nation building and to restore peace in war-riddled territories by settling conflicts and easing tensions in these regions. Aside from these, the WFP has also supported efforts to promote innovation, sustainable livelihoods, climate action, gender equality. </p>
                <p id="body">In 2021 alone, WFP aided more than 128 million people through the $9.6 billion they raised in the same year. Among these were the 12.2 million people who benefited from WFP's climate risk management solutions, the 23.5 million people who benefited from WFP's campaigns against malnutrition, the nearly 1 million smallholder farmers who were partnered and assisted, the 8.7 million individuals who received additional food assistance, and a total of 41.8 million individuals that received cash assistance amounting to $2.3 billion. </p>
                <p id="body">Throughout its history, the WFP has positively affected the lives of many individuals, and looking forward, will continue to live on to their promise of saving lives and changing lives. </p>
